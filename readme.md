# Geometry2D
Basic shapes and related geometrical concepts come up frequently, this basic module defines structures and functions providing common calculations.
This module is not attempting to be a 2D sketcher but rather provides clear, explicit, and verbose functions that improve users' maintainability and conceptual clarity.

Included entities/concepts:
* Points
* Triangles
* Circles
* Ellipses
* Spirals
* Homogeneous transforms
