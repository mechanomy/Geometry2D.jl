# Geometry2D
Basic shapes and related geometrical concepts come up frequently, this basic module defines structures and functions providing common calculations.
This module is not attempting to be a 2D sketcher but rather provides clear, explicit, and verbose functions that improve users' maintainability and conceptual clarity.

Included entities/concepts:
* Points
* Triangles
* Circles
* Ellipses
* Spirals
* Homogeneous transforms

Many more entities and functions are under consideration, pending need.
**Please open an [enhancement issue](https://github.com/mechanomy/Geometry2D.jl/issues/new/choose) to help us prioritize our efforts.**
